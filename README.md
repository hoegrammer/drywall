Differences from the standard Drywall
=====================================

This fork of Drywall is simpler in that it does not have separate entities for User, Account and Admin. Instead it just has one User entity.

In standard Drywall, for a user to be a member of a permissioned group, it has to have an Admin entity. The Admin entity is related to the group. In this version, the groups sit on the User entity directly.

The notion of Roles has not been entirely removed, however, I think that is the next step. Groups provide one permissioning system; why have two?


Drywall
=============

A website and user system for Node.js. What you create with Drywall is more important than Drywall.

Requirements
------------

You need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) installed and running.

We use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as our task runner. Get the CLI (command line interface).

```bash
$ npm install grunt-cli -g
```

We use [`bcrypt`](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js) for hashing secrets. If you have issues during installation related to `bcrypt` then [refer to this wiki page](https://github.com/jedireza/drywall/wiki/bcrypt-Installation-Trouble).

Installation
------------

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:layerzerolabs/drywall.git && cd ./drywall
$ npm install
$ mv ./config.example.js ./config.js #set mongodb and email credentials
$ grunt
```

Setup
------------

You need a few records in the database to start using the user system.

Run these commands on mongo. __Obviously you should use your email address.__

```js
use drywall; //your mongo db name
```

```js
db.admingroups.insert({ _id: 'root', name: 'Root' });
db.admins.insert({ name: {first: 'Root', last: 'Admin', full: 'Root Admin'}, groups: ['root'] });
db.users.save({ username: 'root', isActive: 'yes', email: 'your@email.addy', roles: ['admin'], groups: ['root' });
var rootUser = db.users.findOne();
```

Now just use the reset password feature to set a password.

 - `http://localhost:3000/login/forgot/`
 - Submit your email address and wait a second.
 - Go check your email and get the reset link.
 - `http://localhost:3000/login/reset/:email/:token/`
 - Set a new password.

Login. Customize. Enjoy.

Philosophy
------------

 - Create a website and user system.
 - Write code in a simple and consistent way.
 - Only create minor utilities or plugins to avoid repetitiveness.
 - Find and use good tools.
 - Use tools in their native/default behavior.

Features
------------

 - Basic front end web pages.
 - Contact page has form to email.
 - Login system with forgot password and reset password.
 - Signup and Login with Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Google and Tumblr.
 - Optional email verification during signup flow.
 - User system with separate account and admin roles.
 - Admin groups with shared permission settings.
 - Administrator level permissions that override group permissions.
 - Global admin quick search component.

Contributing
------------

Contributions welcome. Make sure your code passes `grunt lint` without error.

If you're changing something non-trivial or user-facing, you may want to submit an issue first.
